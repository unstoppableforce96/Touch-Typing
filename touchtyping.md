# Touch Typing

## Learn How to Touch Type

- Touch typing is all about the idea that each finger has its own area on the keyboard. Thanks to that fact you can type without looking at the keys. Practice regularly and your fingers will learn their location on the keyboard through muscle memory.

## Sitting posture for typing
- Sit straight and remember to keep your back straight.
- Keep your elbows bent at the right angle.
- Face the screen with your head slightly tilted forward.
- Keep at least 45 - 70 cm of distance between your eyes and the screen.
- Ð•xpose the shoulder, arm, and wrist muscles to the least possible strain. The wrists can touch the tabletop in front of the keyboard. Never shift your body weight to the wrists by resting on them.
